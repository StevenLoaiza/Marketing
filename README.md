## Objective

- Design a model to detect if a policy holder will make a service payment call.
- Send marketing material to entice the policy holder to use our self service payment channels.

## About the Data

<b>Policyholder Payment</b>: The data contains customers who had a bill due in the next 5 days and whether they made a service payment call. The transactions dates range between May 13 2014 – May 20 2014, with a total of 129,277 payments.

  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Count</th>

Note: Any inference that we uncover from this data will not represent the population of policyholder payments. There can be seasonality impacts in terms of service payment calls, that would change the distribution and underlying behaviors.

## Data Visulaization

### Feature Correlation
<p>

</p>

The payments made through an self service channel (SSC) within 6 months and within 3 months are highly correlated. (3m is a subset of 6m). Additionally, the feature EVENT1_30_FLAG as no color gradient. After further examination the feature has zero variance.

Attempted to remove the intersection between these features but the correlation persists (see below).

### Age x Tenure
- There are no distinguishable clusters (Age x Tenure) that make more service payment calls.
- We would expect that older policy holders will make more service payment calls, but the chart also shows young adults (<=30) are still calling in.

### Service Calls- Class Imblanace

There is significant class imbalance in the dataset that we will neeed to deal with when creating the predictive model(s).

The ROC curve is an optimistic measure for an imbalanced class. Recall that the ROC curve measures how well the model is distinguishing both classes, but due to the over representation of the negative class, the FPT will be low for many thresholds while the TPR increases steadily. This type of measure does not tell us how well we are doing at correctly classifyin the treu cases.

The Precision-Recall curve demonstrates how well our model is doing at correctly detecting positive sample on two front:

- % of predicted (+) classes that are correct
- % of (+) cases that we correctly identify

### Modeling Pipeline

Can we do better?

A modeling pipeline is developed to enhance model performance. The pipeline will create multiple models for a set of hyperparameters and then choose the best performing combination of parameters on the validation set.

### Feature Engineering
Below is a list with explanations of each new feature.

- Cancel_autom: Cancelled automated payments (0/1)
- SSP_6M: Percent of self-service payment in the last 6 months.
- SSP_15d: Was the payment made in the last 15 days potentially made through SSC? (0/1)
- Day : Day of the week for the transaction.
- State_grp : Rated State grouped by (ascending) Call_Flag=1.
